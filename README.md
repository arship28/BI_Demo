# BI_Demo
This repository comprises of a three layer demo BI(Business Intelligence) dashboard using Power BI, using dummy data. 
The project uses Microsoft Power BI for visualization of a finance dashboard, using dummy finance data. The first layer of the three-tier consists of the Key Point Indicators (KPI) in a gist, the second tier shows further breakdown of each of the KPIs, while the third tier provides the ultimate report format breakdown, for the KPIs. Clicking on each of the board leads to the second layer for the particular KPI and every layer is filterable using the filter options.
